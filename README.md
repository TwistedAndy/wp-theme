### WordPress starter theme

This is the advanced starter theme for WordPress. It includes a lot of useful functions to speed up the development.

The main theme configuration is placed in **`settings.php`** file and stored as associative array. You can edit the current example to add custom menus, sidebars, register new post types and taxonomies. Also you can specify the new image sizes, ajax hanglers, widgets and add custom filters.

This theme also includes the basic styles for the posts, content elements, pagination and comments. If you don't use SASS, you can delete **`scss`** directory and place your styles directly in **`css/style.css`** file.
